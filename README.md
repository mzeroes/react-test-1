# [ðŸš€ Deployed Heroku Server](https://fast-bastion-68939.herokuapp.com/)

Build a working chat app for multiple users with multiple users (many to many).
 
- 1. Use React-Virtualized (for list component) - both users list on left side and chat list will be done using this.
- 2. Semantic-UI-react (for a nice UI). No need to spend time writing your own CSS for beautification.
- 3. Pusher.com (as an easy way to get chat api). No need to set up your own socket.io . This is where you figure out how to use the Pusher API to get many-to-many chat working.
- 4. Extra brownie points - serviceworker (to show an alert in case  of app going offline)

## **Technology Used**
- React
- NodeJS
- Express
